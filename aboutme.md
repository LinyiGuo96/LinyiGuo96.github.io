# Introduction

Hey, my name is Lincoln Guo.

嘿，我叫郭林怡。

I am currently doing some stuff about quantitative analytics at [Scotiabank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank). You are welcome to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincolnguo) profile, if you want to know more about my work experience.

我目前在丰业银行做一些关于量化分析的工作。如果你想了解更多关于我的工作经验，欢迎浏览我的领英简介。

I am also a project-oriented data analyst with 2+ years of experience in data management, data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning, and own excellent analytical skills with ability to create reports and convey results clearly and succinctly. Demonstrated record of facilitating predictions and performing ad-hoc analysis based on research. Proficient in many data programming languages. Work well both independently and as part of a collaborative team with great communication skills. 

我也是一名以项目为导向的数据分析师，在数据管理、数据分析、统计建模和机器学习方面拥有两年以上的经验，并拥有出色的分析能力，能够创建报告并清晰简洁地传达结果。有事实证明我可以在研究的基础上促进预测和执行特别的分析。精通多种数据编程语言。无论是独立工作，还是作为具有出色沟通技巧的协作团队的一员，都能很好地工作。

My master's study was majored in statistics and supervised by [Prof. Aaron Smith](https://science.uottawa.ca/mathstat/en/people/smith-aaron), who is an excellent and kindly young associate professor at [uOttawa](https://science.uottawa.ca/mathstat/en). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [Zhengzhou University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou_University), China, and my undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Feng Li](http://www5.zzu.edu.cn/math/info/1054/2133.htm).

我的硕士专业是统计学，Aaron Smith教授是我的导师，他也是渥太华大学一位非常杰出和蔼的年轻教授。在此之前，我从郑州大学获取了我的数学与应用数学本科证书，同时我的本科论文是由李锋老师指导的。

Speaking of interest, I like soccer, hiking, singing and (sort of) work-out. I like programming and coding, although debugging are quite annoying from time to time. I like to make friends with different people in different realms with different hobbies at different ages from different countries _(Remind me if you think we should add more `different` here)_:smirk:. And I have also promised Gracie that we will take a long trip each year.

说到兴趣，我喜欢足球、郊游、唱歌和健身（可能？）。我喜欢编程和代码，尽管有时调试很烦人。我喜欢和来自不同国家、不同年龄、不同爱好、不同领域的人交朋友 _(提醒我如果你认为我们应该在这儿加上更多`不同`)_。我还向大大保证，我们每年都会进行一次长途旅行。

In a word, personally, I would like to take myself as a not-that-interesting but still intersting person.

总之，就我个人来讲，我认为自己是一个不那么有趣的有趣的人。

# Research 

My graduate research is mainly related to [seasonal adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment), which is a common and useful technique used in time-series and finantial areas. Briefly, my work is to study how to utilize [state-space models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) (sometimes aka hidden Markov models, HMM) to achieve SA with the same even better effect compared with the conventional methods based on ARIMA models. There is a link to my master's thesis in the `PUBLICATIONS` of the navigation.

My undergraduate thesis is to study the mobile phone customer loss problem. In specific, I utilized suvival analysis to analyze the factors' importance and trained some trees and logistic models to make prediction in order to prevent customer loss in advance. The whole project is [here](https://github.com/LinyiGuo96/MyBachelorThesis).

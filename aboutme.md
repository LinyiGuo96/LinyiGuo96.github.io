# Introduction

Hi, my name is Linyi (Lincoln) Guo, a new graduate with a master's degree in Statistics from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://science.uottawa.ca/mathstat/en), University of Ottawa, supervised by [Prof. Aaron Smith](http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asmi28/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [Zhengzhou University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou_University), China.

I am a project oriented Data Analyst with 2+ years of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning. Excellent analytical skills with ability to create reports and convey results clearly and succinctly. Demonstrated record of facilitating predictions and performing ad-hoc analysis based on research. Proficient in many data programming languages. Work well both independently and as part of a collaborative team with great communication skills.

Speaking of the research, my graduate research is mainly related to [seasonal adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment), which is a common and useful technique used in time-series and finantial areas. Briefly, my work is to study how to utilize [state-space models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) (sometimes aka hidden Markov models) to achieve SA with the same even better effect compared with the conventional methods based on ARIMA models. If you are interested in or have some problems regrading SA problem, I am always open to talk to! My 'naive' and final intention is to come up with a mature application to beat the current algorithms including X-11 and SEATS, thus if you are a guy in SSM and seeking for cooperation, please do NOT hesitate to contact me:)

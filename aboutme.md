# Introduction

Hi, my name is Linyi (Lincoln) Guo.

I am currently working with counterparty credit risk data at [Scotiabank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank). ~~I am also a project-oriented Data Analyst with 2+ years of experience in data management, data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning, and own excellent analytical skills with ability to create reports and convey results clearly and succinctly. Demonstrated record of facilitating predictions and performing ad-hoc analysis based on research. Proficient in many data programming languages. Work well both independently and as part of a collaborative team with great communication skills.~~ My goal is to be a **REAL** lifelong learner.

My master's study was majored in statistics and supervised by [Prof. Aaron Smith](http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asmi28/), who is an excellent and kindly young associate professor at [uOttawa](https://science.uottawa.ca/mathstat/en). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [Zhengzhou University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou_University), China, and my undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Feng Li](http://www5.zzu.edu.cn/math/info/1054/2133.htm).

During my leisure time, I like to play soccer, sing and also go to the gym sometimes. I like programming and coding, although debugging are quite annoying from time to time. I like to make friends with different people in different realms at different ages from different countries. And I have also promised Gracie that we will take a long trip each year.

# Research 

My graduate research is mainly related to [seasonal adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment), which is a common and useful technique used in time-series and finantial areas. Briefly, my work is to study how to utilize [state-space models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) (sometimes aka hidden Markov models, HMM) to achieve SA with the same even better effect compared with the conventional methods based on ARIMA models. There is a link to my master's thesis in the `PUBLICATIONS` of the navigation.

My undergraduate thesis is to study the mobile phone customer loss problem. In specific, I utilized suvival analysis to analyze the factors' importance and trained some trees and logistic models to make prediction in order to prevent customer loss in advance. The whole project is [here](https://github.com/LinyiGuo96/MyBachelorThesis).

# _Preface_

_The motivation behind this blog is coming from my preparation for software/data engineer interviews. If you are an experienced expert, please go find some other funny YouTube videos so you won't waste a few minutes here (just joke).  The data structures below might not be a lot, but they are the common ones that professionals use in the real coding/programming projects. They are not just useful for the SDE/DE roles, for any jobs related to programming/algorithms, they will be very handy!_

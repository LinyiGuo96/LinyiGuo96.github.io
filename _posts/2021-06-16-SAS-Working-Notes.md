I have to admit that an actual industrial project is truly different from what I expected, when I was a new graduate. Anothing truth is, although the procedure is far more complex, the real technical part, in my opinion, is still the same.

**CALL SYMPUT**: Assigns a value produced in a DATA step to a macro variable.

```
CALL SYMPUT(macro-variable, value);
```

Today is the first time that G (one of my friend) truly experienced the workplace PUA, which is a really really really terrible experience. Here is his experience in the past few days:

**Story 1**

G was assigned with a dataset at 4 pm last Thursday, then the next day at 11 am, his manager came to ask whether he finished or not, G said no; then at 2 pm, his manager came and asked again, but G was still working on it at that time, which is the truth, because that's his first real project in that company, and as a new employee, G was not familiar with the whole bunch of files and data standards! 

After G told his manager that he was still working on that dataset, his manager asked him: 

"why it takes you two days to finish the first step?" 

"Are you working?" 

_At that time, G's inner thought is: "WTF? You gave it to me yesterday at 4 pm :) And you never told me you want this dataset so hastily! WITHIN HALF OF A DAY! Are you kidding me? FOR A NEW EMPLOYEE! WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS?"_

But bowing to the reality, G's true answer is:

"Sorry, I was working on the sandbox exercise before. And I just got this project at 4 pm yesterday."

"I will spend more time on it."

Guess what happened next? His manager told G to finish this dataset by the end of day, which is understandable, but this manager's original message is:

"SPEND ALL YOUR TIME ON IT NOW. GET A DRAFT TODAY." 

The much more ridiculous thing is, when G submitted the work at 5:30 pm (he was expected to leave at 5 pm) and came back after dinner, he found his manager skyped him at 5:45 pm asking his phone number. 


**Story 2**

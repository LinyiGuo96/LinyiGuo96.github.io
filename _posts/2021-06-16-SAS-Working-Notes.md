I have to admit that an actual industrial project is truly different from what I expected, when I was a new graduate. Anothing truth is, although the procedure is far more complex, the real technical part, in my opinion, is still the same.

**CALL SYMPUT**: Assigns a value produced in a DATA step to a macro variable.

```
CALL SYMPUT(macro-variable, value);
```

Today is the first time that G (one of my friend) truly experienced the workplace PUA, which is a really really really terrible experience. Here is his experience in the past few days:

**Story 1**

G was assigned with a dataset at 4 pm last Thursday, then the next day at 11 am, his manager came to ask whether he finished or not, G said no; then at 2 pm, his manager came and asked again, but G was still working on it at that time, which is the truth, because that's his first real project in that company, and as a new employee, G was not familiar with the whole bunch of files and data standards! 

After G told his manager that he was still working on that dataset, his manager asked him: 

"why it takes you two days to finish the first step?" 

"Are you working?" 

_At that time, G's inner thought is: "WTF? You gave it to me yesterday at 4 pm :) And you never told me you want this dataset so hastily! WITHIN HALF OF A DAY! Are you kidding me? FOR A NEW EMPLOYEE! WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS?"_

But bowing to the reality, G's true answer is:

"Sorry, I was working on the sandbox exercise before. And I just got this project at 4 pm yesterday."

"I will spend more time on it."

Guess what happened next? His manager told G to finish this dataset by the end of day, which is understandable, but this manager's original message is:

"SPEND ALL YOUR TIME ON IT NOW. GET A DRAFT TODAY." 

The much more ridiculous thing is, when G submitted the work at 5:30 pm (he was expected to leave at 5 pm) and came back after dinner, he found his manager skyped him at 5:45 pm asking his phone number.

**%sysfunc()**: Execute SAS functions or user-written functions.

```
%SYSFUNC(function(argument(s))<, format>);
```

where `function` is the name of the function to execute. This function can be a SAS function, a function written with SAS/TOOLKIT software, or a function created using the FCMP Procedure in Base SAS Procedures Guide. The function **_CANNOT_** be a macro function. `format` is an optional format to apply to the result of function. This format can be provided by SAS, generated by PROC FORMAT, or created with SAS/TOOLKIT. There is no default value for format. If you do not specify a format, the SAS macro facility does not perform a format operation on the result and uses the default of the function.

**PWD**: Print Working Directory

**SYSGET**: function, returns the value of the specified operating-environment variable.

**GETOPTION**: function, returns the value of a SAS system or graphics option.

**%EVAL**: Evaluates arithmetic and logical expressions using integer arithmetic. 

%EVAL operates by converting its argument from a character value to a numeric or logical expression. Then, it performs the evaluation. Finally, %EVAL converts the result back to a character value and returns that value.

**libname ... INENCODING=, OUTENCODING=**: The INENCODING= option is used to read SAS data sets in the SAS library. The OUTENCODING= option is used to write SAS data sets in the SAS library.

**OPTIONS MISSING = System option**: Specifies the character to print for missing numeric values.

**OPTIONS NONUMBER**: Suppress page numbers.

**OPTIONS NOTES**: Specifies whether notes are written to the SAS log.

**OPTIONS SOURCE**: Specifies whether SAS writes source statements to the SAS log.

Similarly for arguments including **mprint** and **mlogic**.

**OPTIONS FMTSEARCH**: Specifies the order in which format catalogs are searched.

**OPTIONS SASAUTOS**: Specifies the location of one or more autocall libraries.

```
options ps = &stndrdps ls =&stndrdls nodate center nonumber missing = " ";
options notes source mprint mlogic symbolgen=yes msglevel=i  validvarname=v7;
options fmtsearch=(raw tab ana) sasautos = ('!SASROOT/sasautos/' "&wkdir/macros/" "&wkdir/macros/utilities/");
```

Remember **CALL SYMPUT**: Assigns a value produced in a DATA step to a macro variable. 

```
CALL SYMPUT(macro-variable, value);
```

Now, **CALL SYMPUTX**: Assigns a value to a macro variable, and removes both leading and trailing blanks.

```
CALL SYMPUTX(macro-variable, value <, symbol-table>);
```

which is doing the same work as 

```
call symput(macro, trim(left(value)));
```

**NOBS**: a SAS automatic variable which contains the number of records in the data set named in the set statement.

```
data _NULL_;
	if 0 then set sashelp.class nobs=n;
	call symputx('nrows',n);
	stop;
run;
%put nobs=&nrows;
```

**PUT**: Use the PUT function to convert a numeric value to a character value. You cannot use the PUT function to directly change the type of variable in a data set from numeric to character. However, you can create a new character variable as the result of the PUT function. 

**INPUT**: The INPUT function enables you to convert the value of source by using a specified informat. The informat determines whether the result is numeric or character. Use INPUT to convert character values to numeric values or other character values.

```
var1 = PUT(source, format.);
var2 = INPUT(source, <? | ??> informat.);
```

Sick.

## _20210622_

**best.**: SAS chooses the best notation when a format is not specified for writing a numeric value. For example,
```
var = put(x, best.);
```

**_name_**: appears when using a tranpose step, so let's talk about the transpose step.

## _20210623_

**PROC TRANSPOSE**: 

**STRIP**: Returns a character string with all leading and trailing blanks removed.

**Put proc sort into a data step**

```
data ...;

statements;

proc sort; 
by ...;

run;
```

## _20210624_

**index(source, string);**: Searches a character expression for a string of characters, and returns the position of the string's first character for the first occurrence of the string.

## _20210625_

SO FAR SO GOOD.

## _20210628_

**Array**: a list of variables(columns) in SAS. See [here](https://linyiguo96.github.io//2021-04-28-SAS-Advanced-Study-Notes/#array).

**PROC COMPARE**: Compares the contents of two SAS data sets, selected variables in different data sets, or variables within the same data set. See [here](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/proc/n0c1y14wyd3u7yn1dmfcpaejllsn.htm).

```
libname proclib 'SAS-library';
options nodate pageno=1 linesize=80 pagesize=40;
proc compare base=proclib.one compare=proclib.two nosummary;
   var gr1;
   with gr2;
   title 'Comparison of Variables in Different Data Sets';
run;
```

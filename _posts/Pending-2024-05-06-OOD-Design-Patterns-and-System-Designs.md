# Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

OOD is a methodology used in software engineering for designing and organizing code in a way that models real-world entities as objects. It's based on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, which help in creating modular, scalable and maintainable software systems. 

A brief overview of some key concepts:
1. objects (对象): instances of classes and represent real-world entities with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Eg, a car (object) can have attributes such as weight, color and size, and methods such as accelerating, braking, turning. 
2. classes (类): blueprints for creating obejcts. Classes define the property and behavior of objects by encapsulating data (attributes) and operations (methods) that can be performed on them. Eg, a CAR class defines the attributes like color and model, and also the methods like accelerate() and brake().
3. abstraction (抽象): involves  hiding the complex implementation details of objects while exposing only the essential features that are relevant to the user. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, thereby simplifying the complexity of the system and making it easier to understand, use and maintain.   
4. encapsulation (封装): the bundling of the data (attributes) and methods within a class, along with the hiding of internal state of objects and the controlling access to them through well-defined interfaces. It promotes data integrity, code, organization, and flexibility.
6. inheritance (继承): Inheritance is a mechanism where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and allows for creating hierarchical relationships between classes. For example, a "Car" class may inherit common properties and behaviors from a more general "Vehicle" class.
7. Polymorphism (多态): Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are invoked on, facilitating code flexibility and extensibility. For example, the same "drive()" method can exhibit different behaviors for a "Car" object and a "Bicycle" object.




# Design Patterns

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common design problems at a lower level of abstraction. They focus on the structure of individual components or classes within a software system. Learning design patterns first can help you understand fundamental principles of software design, such as abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity. It can also improve your ability to design and implement well-structured and maintainable code.

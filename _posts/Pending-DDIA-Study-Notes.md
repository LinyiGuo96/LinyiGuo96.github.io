# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

*Designing Data-Intensive Applications* introduces the core themes of building software systems that can handle data reliably, scale efficiently, and be maintained over time.

## Key Concepts

- **Reliability:** The system works correctly despite hardware/software faults. Includes fault tolerance, error handling, and backups.
- **Scalability:** The ability to handle increasing load by scaling up (bigger machine) or scaling out (more machines).
- **Maintainability:** How easy it is to understand, fix, and extend the system.

## Why These Qualities Matter

Modern data systems face huge data volumes, high availability needs, and rapid evolution. Meeting these challenges requires tradeoffs.

## Takeaways

- Designing systems with these properties in mind from the start is essential.
- Understanding system bottlenecks and failure modes guides better architecture choices.

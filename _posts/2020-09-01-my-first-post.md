I have wished to build my own website and write some blogs on it for a
long time. Now, this wish finally comes true, but after my graduation.
Yes, I just graduated from UofO with a M.Sc. degree in Statistics, thus
I am not an IT/CS guy technically speaking, this could be one of reasons
that prevented me from doing this stuff.

Anyway, now I have it and am able to share my study/learning record on
it, which is good enough!

The world is always unknown, let's see what will happen in the future!
Cheers :)
